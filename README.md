            <h1>Romeo And Juliet</h1>
            <h3>ACT 1</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
            <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
            <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
            <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
            <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
            <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
            <p>Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows</p>
            <p>Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
            <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
            <p>Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,</p>
            <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
            <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>SCENE I.Vrona. A public place.</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p>Enter SAMSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, with swords and bucklers.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>SAMSON</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p> Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>GREGORY</h3>
            <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
